# StarterKit

The purpose of starter kit is for beginners that are already familiar with HTML and CSS a place to begin working on their projects.  You should be familiar with using the sass file structure.  I have included .scss files for you that follow an atomic design sense of development

The files are blank except for _normalize.scss, _reset.scss, and _helpers.scss.  I have also included an HTML boilerplate courtesy of [Tania Rascia](https://taniarascia.github.io/primitive/).

This kit uses the normalize css reset incorparted into the _normalize.scss file.  Gulp functions have been written to intergrate BrowserSync from your application directory. Uncomment the BrowserSync code in the gulpfile.js to use BrowserSync from a virtual host server.

To install and run from the command line (don't forget to navigate to the desired directory - if applicable):

    git clone https://github.com/chrismgonzalez/starterkit.git

    npm install

    gulp

I will be updating this set of files as its uses grow. I hope to add functionality for more gulp files and workflows.
